## WikiWeb Chrome Extension

![Image of WikiWeb](../WikiWebScreenshot.png)

WikiWeb is my capstone project for FullStack Acadmey. It is an extension that runs in the background and tracks users' web history when the visit WikiPedia.org . It allows the user to visualize and analyze their personal Wikipedia browsing history.

When we started to brainstorm ideas for a project we knew we wanted to bulid an app around user data. We ageered that complex data, when visualized effectively, often tell compelling stories. So we came up with the idea to track Wikipedia browsing history.


While a user visits a Wikipeida page  extension pulls the page titel, url and some content. Traversing from page to page the WikiWeb follows and bulids out a visual representation of the browsing history. Upon entering the app users can can back and see how they traversed Wikipedia. 


The extension is built by using the Chrome API to collect user information, page content and traversal history. Data is passed to an Express server, stored in a Postgress database and presents and presents data visualizations using the D3 Javascript library. In addition were used the React frontend framework to manage state and views.

The app dosen't  have to end here however. It could easily be extended be he realm of Wikipedia. As implemented, very little prevents our app from being used to display a userâ€™s YouTube, Facebook, or Reddit habits. 

WikiWeb can be found on the Chrome Web Store! [Click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wiki-web/ckfbjjiofppmjdeobopohbjhlmpdnmae)
